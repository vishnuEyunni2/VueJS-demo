# Intro to Vue 3 components

Component takes template that is rendered.

Components must be made such that they are re-usable.
Components with simple names are best avoided, as they could be conflicting.

# Registering a component

There are two ways we can register a component either globally or locally.

Globally registering a component will make it available across the app. This however may not be required for all components, as they may not be of use, but still be loaded.
